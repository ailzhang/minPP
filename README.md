# Pipeline Parallelism for Minimalists

Every paper seems to present pipeline schedules in a slightly different setup, which makes it hard to compare them side by side. So I went down the rabbit hole and built a tiny simulator to explore them in a unified way.

It‚Äôs a lightweight, CPU-only tool that lets you:

- Mix and match partitioning, assignment, and execution strategies
- Simulate microbatch flows step by step
- Visualize all schedules in a consistent timeline format

The whole thing is under 1,000 lines of code‚Äînot production-ready, a bit rough around the edges‚Äîbut it helped me understand and compare schedules much more clearly.

## Bug reports

This repo started as a toy side project without thorough and there will definitely be rough edges. PRs and bug reports are welcome!
